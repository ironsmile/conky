# My Status Conky

This is a conky config I on my main desktop to check the status of my PC
at a glance.

## Installation

Place this repository under `$HOME/.conky/conky_grey_redux/` and then add this
to your startup applications:

```
conky --pause 5 -c /home/iron4o/.conky/conky_grey_redux/conkyrc_grey
```

I like the 5s pause so that the desktop environment has time to load all
of its stuff without conky adding more processes into the mix.

## Credits

I've found this theme on some conky themes website and improved it
beyond recognition. Still, the original author was SLK. So thanks, mate!
